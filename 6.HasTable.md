# Hash Tables

Hash table is an associative data structure that relates a key and a value using a hash function, this function is used to calculate the index where the elements that we are saving in the table should go.

The hash table save the elements in slots or backets, and the table could have an arbitray numbers od slots and is the task of the hash function to determine in witch slot have to go each element

is the hash function the one that determine witch is the cost of this data strcuture

In hash tables coul happend a thing call a colision and is when more than one elements is asigned to the same slot by the hash function and by the moment that more than one elements go to the same slot, it will added as a linked list in the slot and the time when we watch to obtain an element we have to go throug all the elements of the linked list.

## Applications of hash tables

- Used to implement database indexes.
- Used to implement associative arrays.
- Used to implement the “set” data structure.
