# Array

Is a group of elements stored together at contiguous memory locations and each cell has a corresponding numeric index used to select its data. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.

```js
var users=["neha","ayushi","gauri"];  // creating an array  
```

In arrays, You know the address for every item in your array, that is whay arrays are great if you want to read random elements, because you can look up any element in your array instantly. "O(1)"

Inserting elements to an array and deleting elements from an array cannot be done straight away as arrays are fixed in size "everything needs to be moved up to antoher space location every time you delete or add an element". "O(n)"

Unlike insertions, deletions will always work. Insertions can fail sometimes when thereâ€™s no space left in memory. But you can always delete an element.

## Applications of arrays

- Used as the building blocks to build other data structures such as array lists, heaps, hash tables, vectors and matrices.

- Used for different sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, quick sort, bubble sort and merge sort.
