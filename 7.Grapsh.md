# Graphs

A graph is a complex data structure consists of:
- a finite set of vertices also called as nodes
- a finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. 

A graph can be seen more like a network. The interconnected objects are represented by points known as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges. A vertex is just similar to the linked list nodes and the pair (x,y) referred as an edge which means that the x vertex connects to the y vertex.

There are two common types of graphs:

- **Undirected Graphs:** In an undirected graph, edges are not associated with the directions with them. It means if an edge exists between vertex X and Y then the vertices can be traversed from Y to X as well as X to Y.
- **Directed Graphs:** In a directed graph, edges are associated with the directions with them. It means if an edge exists between vertex X and Y then the vertices can be traversed from X to Y only. Here, vertex A is called the initial node while vertex B is called the terminal node.

## Representation

The graphs can be represented in two ways:

- **adjacency matrix:** Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph. are very good when we want to obtain in a very fast way the conectivity of 2 nodes.
- **adjacency list:** very common when the number of vertix is biger  than the number of edges.

## Graph traversal

In computer science, graph traversal (also known as graph search) refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the vertices are visited. Tree traversal is a special case of graph traversal.

### **Depth-first search**

A depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing a finite graph. DFS visits the child vertices before visiting the sibling vertices; that is, it traverses the depth of any particular path before exploring its breadth.

The algorithm begins with a chosen "root" vertex; it then iteratively transitions from the current vertex to an adjacent, unvisited vertex, until it can no longer find an unexplored vertex to transition to from its current location. The algorithm then backtracks along previously visited vertices, until it finds a vertex connected to yet more uncharted territory. It will then proceed down the new path as it had before, backtracking as it encounters dead-ends, and ending only when the algorithm has backtracked past the original "root" vertex from the very first step.

### **Breadth-first search**

A breadth-first search (BFS) is another technique for traversing a finite graph. BFS visits the sibling vertices before visiting the child vertices, and a queue is used in the search process. This algorithm is often used to find the shortest path from one vertex to another.

## Applications of graphs

Graphs are the ultimate abstraction for many real-world problems. Some of the best use cases for Graph Data Structures include:

- Social media networks (like LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.)
- Path Optimization Algorithms(like Google maps)
- Web Analytics and Scientific Computations.
- Represent locations and routes in GPS. Locations are vertices and the routes connecting locations are edges. Used to calculate the shortest route between two locations.
