/**
Array
A linear collection of data values that are accessible at numbered indices, 
starting at index 0.

The following are an array's standard operations and their corresponding time 
complexities:
- Accessing a value at a given index: 0(1)
- Updating a value at a given index: 0(1)
- Inserting a value at the beginning: O(n)
- Inserting a value in the middle: O(n)
- Inserting a value at the end: amortized O(1) when dealing with a dynamic array O(n) when dealing with a static array
- Removing a value at the beginning: O(n) 
- Removing a value in the middle: O(n)
- Removing a value at the end: 0(1)
- Copying the array: O(n)
