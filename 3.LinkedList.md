# Linked List

Linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are not in contiguous memory locations like arrays. It consists of a group of nodes and each node has its own data and address to the next node. In an array, the elements are indexed and you can instantly get to an element but in a linked list, you have to start with the head and work your way through until you get to the desired element.

The advantage of the linked list is that the insertion and deletion in linked list are easier than array, as the elements in an array are stored in a consecutive location. Also, its memory consumption is efficient as the size of the linked list can grow or shrink according to our requirements.
