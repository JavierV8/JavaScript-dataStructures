# Trees

The tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains some data and the link of other nodes that can be called children. The topmost node of the tree is known as a root node. Nodes with linked child nodes are called internal nodes while those without child nodes are external nodes(leaf nodes).

# Applications of trees

- Binary Trees: Used to implement expression parsers and expression solvers.
- Binary Search Tree: used in many search applications where data are constantly entering and leaving.
- Heaps: used by JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to store Java objects.
- Treaps: used in wireless networking.

There are a number of different types of trees:-

## Binary Tree

Trees nodes can have zero or more children. However, when a tree has at the most two children, then it’s called binary tree.

### Full, Complete, and Perfect binary trees

Depending on how nodes are arranged in a binary tree, it can be full, complete and perfect:

- Full binary tree: each node has exactly 0 or 2 children (but never 1).
- Complete binary tree: when all levels except the last one are full with nodes.
- Perfect binary tree: when all the levels (including the last one) are full of nodes.

# Binary Search Tree (BST)

Binary Search Trees or BST for short are a particular application of binary trees. BST has at most two nodes (like all binary trees). However, the values are so that the left children value must be less than the parent, and the right children must be higher.

Duplicates: Some BST doesn’t allow duplicates while others add the same values as a right child. Other implementations might keep a count on a case of duplicity (we are going to do this one later).
