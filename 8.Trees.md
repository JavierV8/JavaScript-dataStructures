# Trees

The tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains some data and the link of other nodes that can be called children. The topmost node of the tree is known as a root node. Nodes with linked child nodes are called internal nodes while those without child nodes are external nodes(leaf nodes).
There are a number of different types of trees:-

1.) Binary Tree
2.) Binary Search Tree
3.) AVL Tree
4.) Balanced tree
5.) Red black tree
6.) 2-3 tree
7.) N-ary tree

Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree are typically the most often used.

//----------------

A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together. This structure is different from a linked list whereas, in a linked list, items are linked in a linear order.

Every node in a binary search tree comprises the following attributes.
key: The value stored in the node.
left: The pointer to the left child.
right: The pointer to the right child.
p: The pointer to the parent node.

# Applications of trees

- Binary Trees: Used to implement expression parsers and expression solvers.
- Binary Search Tree: used in many search applications where data are constantly entering and leaving.
- Heaps: used by JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to store Java objects.
- Treaps: used in wireless networking.
