# Queues

Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO(First In First Out) principle. It contains two-pointers:
- front pointer: The front pointer contains the address of the starting element.
- rear pointer: The rear pointer contains the address of the last element of the queue.

The two main methods used for the implementation of the queue are:
- enqueue: Enqueuing is the process of adding an element in the queue
- dequeue: is the process of removing an element from the queue.

## Applications of queues

- Used to manage threads in multithreading.
- Used to implement queuing systems (e.g.: priority queues).
