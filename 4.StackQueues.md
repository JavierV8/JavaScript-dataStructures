# Stack

Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out) principle. It contains only one pointer the top pointer that points to the topmost element of the stack. Whenever we add an element to the stack, it is added at the top of the stack and also whenever we delete an element from the stack it is deleted from the top of the stack.

Unlike an array, a stack does not offer constant-time access to the ith item. However, it does allow constanttime adds and removes, as it doesn't require shifting elements around. 

## Stack operations

- Push: Insert an element on to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Delete the topmost element and return it.
- Peek: Return the top element of the stack without deleting it.
- isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
- isFull: Check if the stack is full.

## Applications of stacks

- Used for expression evaluation (e.g.: shunting-yard algorithm for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions).
- Used to implement function calls in recursion programming. 

# Queues

Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO(First In First Out) principle. It contains two-pointers:
- front pointer: The front pointer contains the address of the starting element.
- rear pointer: The rear pointer contains the address of the last element of the queue.

The two main methods used for the implementation of the queue are:
- enqueue: Enqueuing is the process of adding an element in the queue
- dequeue: is the process of removing an element from the queue.

## Applications of queues

- Used to manage threads in multithreading.
- Used to implement queuing systems (e.g.: priority queues).
