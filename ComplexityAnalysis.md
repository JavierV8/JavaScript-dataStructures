# Complexity Analysis

Complexity Analysis is a method by which it can determine how efficient an algorithm is. Complexity analysis usually involves finding both the time complexity and the space complexity of an algorithm.

## Time Complexity

A measure of how fast an algorithm runs.

## Space Complexity

A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up.

The following are examples of common complexities and the Big O notations, ordered from fastest to slowest:

- Constant: 0(1)
- Logarithmic: O(log(n))
- Linear: O(n)
- Log-linear: O(nlog(n))
- Quadratic: O(n²)
- Cubic: O(n³)
- Exponential: O(2)
- Factorial: O(n!)
