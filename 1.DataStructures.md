# Data Structures

In computer science, a data structure is a ways of saving and managing information and depending on which one we use, our algorithms could be slower or faster. In other words, it allow to perform operations on the stored data more efficiently.

Efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms.

I will cover the seven most used JavaScript data structures:

## Linear data structure

Is a kind of Data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, the elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent.

In linear data structure, single level is involved. Therefore, we can traverse all the elements in single run only. 

Linear data structures are easy to implement because computer memory is arranged in a linear way.

- Arrays
- Stack
- Queues
- Linked List
- Hashtable

## Non-linear Data Structures

Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly. 

In a non-linear data structure, single level is not involved. Therefore, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in single run only. 

Non-linear data structures are not easy to implement in comparison to linear data structure. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure.

- Trees
- Graphs
