# Stack

Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out) principle. It contains only one pointer the top pointer that points to the topmost element of the stack. Whenever we add an element to the stack, it is added at the top of the stack and also whenever we delete an element from the stack it is deleted from the top of the stack.

## Stack operations

- Push: Insert an element on to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Delete the topmost element and return it.
- Peek: Return the top element of the stack without deleting it.
- isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
- isFull: Check if the stack is full.

## Applications of stacks

- Used for expression evaluation (e.g.: shunting-yard algorithm for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions).
- Used to implement function calls in recursion programming.
